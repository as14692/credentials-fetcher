What this CDK does:
CDK automation to run Linux gMSA in ECS with EC2 instance in domainless mode . This CDK can be used to test RPMs for AL2023.

This CDK does the following:
Creates directory in Directory Service (Active Directory)
Launch Windows instance, domain-join with Active Directory and create gMSA accounts
Create ECS cluster
Launch ECS-optimized Linux instance and attaches to ECS cluster
Runs a couple of tasks in the ECS-optimized Linux instance using gMSA in domainless mode.

Disclaimer
This CDK and scripts are only for test, please modify as needed.

Create the following environment variables: 
1. AWS_REGION
2. S3_PREFIX
3. KEY_PAIR_NAME
4. PREFIX_LIST

Pre-requisites
Please take a look at data.json for default values.
If you're testing a new RPM, upload it in the S3 bucket.
Ensure you have docker running in the background.

1. Update data.json, and make sure there are no values with "xxxxxxxx"

2) 'default' AWS profile with administrator access is needed, a separate/burner AWS account would suffice.

Steps to run tasks in ECS with Credentials-fetcher.

3) Create a virtual env
        Go to cdk directory

        ```
        $ cd cdk/
        ```
        To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

        ```
        $ python3 -m venv .venv
        ```

        After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
        step to activate your virtualenv.

        ```
        $ source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

        Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

        ```
        $ cd cdk/cdk-domainless-mode
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

        Install AWS cdk

        ```
        $ brew install aws-cdk
        ```

5) Run start_stack.sh (this is a bash script) to create a CloudFormation stack
   2.1) Update start_stack.sh with your aws account number

   2.2) This creates Managed Active Directory, launches Windows instance and domain-joins it and creates the gMSA accounts, launches an ECS-optimized Linux instance, creates a new ECS cluster and attaches it to ECS cluster.
    ```
    (.venv) cdk % ./start_stack.sh
        [10:29:46] CDK toolkit version: 2.156.0 (build 2966832)
        [10:29:46] Command line arguments: {
        _: [ 'bootstrap' ],
    ```
   
6) Run End-To-End SQL test with Credentials Fetcher ECS Domainless Setup
   ```aiignore
      (.venv) tests % python3 run_e2e_test.py
   ```
7) Done: If everything worked as expected, you should see an output like this in the console:
    ```
